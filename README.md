ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Akash !

ðŸ‘€ I'm deeply passionate about AI, ML, Rust, Web development, App Development and IoT - the fascinating realms where technology meets innovation.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm engrossed in a journey of perpetual learning, exploring various programming languages and crafting projects to deepen my understanding and hone my skills.

ðŸ’¡ I'm eagerly seeking opportunities to collaborate with fellow tech enthusiasts who share my zeal for creativity and problem-solving. Whether you have a brilliant idea or simply a shared passion for pushing the boundaries of technology, I'm all ears and open to collaboration.

âš¡ Fun Fact: Despite my fascination with AI, I have a fear of it - a paradoxical blend of curiosity and caution!

Looking forward to connecting with you and exploring exciting possibilities together!
